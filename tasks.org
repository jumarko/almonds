* High level Architecture

** Functionalities
   + stage resources
   + unstage resources
   + pull chamges
   + reset - unstage all, reset pull state
   + diff - show diff - create, delete, inconsistent
   + apply-diff :all :create :delete- calculate the diff and apply it
   + the tags should be generic - I should be able to see resources by type, stack id, or my custom tag.


*** todo
    + create atomic functions
      - stage - in place of commit
      - unstage - remove everything from staging
      - reset - unstage and also empty the pull state
    + replace stack-id with tags. allow a collection of tags to be specified.
